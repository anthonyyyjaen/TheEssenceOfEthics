            <h2>Foundation of Morality: Moral vs. Non-Moral Standard; Dilemmas and its Levels Culture in Moral Behavior</h2>

            <p>
                Essentially, ethics is a field of philosophy that seeks to provide a basic response to the query, "What should I do?In contrast to thoughtless habits, societal norms, or self-interest, people make decisions in this situation after reflecting on their beliefs, principles, and purpose. What gives us a feeling of what is good, right, and significant in our life are our values, principles, and purpose. They operate as a point of reference for every option we have available to us. According to this definition, an ethical decision is one that is compatible with one's views and is founded on reflection about the things we value.

                Moral standards are the principles that people hold about the behaviors they consider to be morally right and wrong, as well as the values they assign to the categories of things they consider to be morally good and terrible. Some ethicists confuse moral principles and moral values with moral standards.

                Regulations that have nothing to do with morality or ethics are referred to as non-moral standards. These standards either don't necessarily relate to morality or are morally illogical by nature. Etiquette norms, dress standards, gaming regulations, and other household rules are basic instances of non-moral standards. Legal legislation, such as laws and ordinances, and some religious precepts are technically non-moral concepts, however they may have ethical significance in certain situations.
