            <h4>Diplomatic Ethics in International Relations</h4>
            <h5>1.	The Art of Diplomacy</h5>
            <p>
                Negotiation, communication, and collaboration are key components of the art of diplomacy, which is the management of foreign affairs. Fundamental to the profession of diplomacy, ethical issues direct states and diplomats in their dealings with one another.
