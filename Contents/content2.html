            <h2>The Moral Agent</h2>

            <p>
                A moral agent is someone who can distinguish between right and wrong and accept responsibility for their own acts. Moral beings have an obligation to avoid from doing unnecessary harm.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Moral agency is traditionally restricted to individuals who can be held accountable for their deeds. It's possible that people with certain mental illnesses, including children, lack the ability to act morally. Adults who are mentally competent give up their moral agency only in dire circumstances, such as when they are being held captive.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                We make people answerable for the harm they do to others by holding them to the standard of moral behavior.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Do companies, then, possess moral agency? Do robots have moral agency as artificial intelligence advances? What about non-human, socially intelligent creatures like elephants and dolphins?
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                It is true that moral agency in these and other circumstances will need to be taken into account by philosophers and legal experts in the future.
