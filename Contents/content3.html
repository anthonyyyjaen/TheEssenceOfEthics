            <h2>Moral Feelings and Decision Making</h2>

            <p>
                The majority of ethical decisions people make are heavily influenced by their emotions, or more specifically, their sentiments and intuitions. Most people are unaware of how strongly their moral decisions are influenced by their emotions. However, scientists believe that without emotions, it is hard to make any significant moral decisions.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Negative inner-directed feelings such as shame, remorse, and embarrassment frequently spur people to moral behavior.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Negative emotions that are focused outward, however, are intended to punish or discipline. For instance, people frequently express their contempt, disgust, or wrath toward someone who have acted unethically. Others are deterred from acting in a similar manner by this.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                People may be moved to act kindly or compassionately when they witness someone else exhibiting these positive emotions, such as gratitude and admiration.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>       
                Suffering-induced emotions, such empathy and pity, frequently motivate people to act morally toward others. In fact, the primary moral feeling that drives prosocial behaviors like cooperation, generosity, and altruism most frequently is empathy.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>       
                Although we may think that our religious or philosophical beliefs have the most influence on our moral judgments, the truth is that our emotions also have a big say in what is morally right or wrong.
