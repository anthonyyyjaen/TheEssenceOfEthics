            <h2>Moral Feelings and Decision Making</h2>

            <p>
                Humans have not only feelings but also reason, and reason plays a vital role inEthics. In fact, moral truths are truths of reason;that is, a moral judgment is true if it isespoused by better reasons than the alternatives.

                Reason is the basis or motive for an action, decision, or conviction. As a quality, it refers to the capacity for logical, rational, and analytic thought; for consciously making sense of things, establishing and verifying facts, applying common sense and logic, and justifying, and if necessary, changing practices, institutions, and beliefs based onexisting or new existing information.

                Impartiality on the other hand involves the idea that each individualâ€™s interestsand point of view are equally important. Also called evenhandedness or fair-mindedness, impartiality is a principle of justice holding that decisions ought to be based on objective criteria, rather on the basis of bias, prejudice, or preferring thebenefit of one person over another for improper reasons. Impartiality, in morality requires that we give equal and/or adequate consideration to the interests of all concerned parties. The principle of impartiality assumes that every person, generally speaking is equally important; that is, no one is seen as intrinsically more significant than anyone else.
