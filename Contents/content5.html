            <h2>Virtue Ethics: St. Thomas Aquinas (Natural law, Happiness – Moral and Cardinal Values)</h2>

            <p>
                St. Thomas Aquinas' moral theory is similar to Aristotle's in that it holds that an action is either good or harmful based on whether it advances or diverts us from our true human end, which is the telos, or ultimate purpose, of all human actions. Here, "happiness" is interpreted in terms of fulfillment, excellence, or wellbeing. However, obtaining happiness necessitates a variety of moral and intellectual qualities that help us comprehend what happiness is and inspire us to pursue it consistently and reliably. However, Aquinas thinks that we can never truly or finally find happiness in this world. For him, beatitude—the transcendent unity with God—is the source of ultimate bliss. Such an aim is well beyond our reach in terms of our inherent human capacities. Because of this, in order for us to be qualified to partake in divine beatitude, we want God to do more than just bestow virtues upon us; rather, we need God to perfect or "deify" our nature.

                Aquinas defines virtue in a number of ways. A virtue is a habit that “disposes an agent to perform its proper operation or movement,” according to one extremely general account.  According to Aquinas, the cardinal virtues—prudence, justice, temperance, and courage—offer broad models for the most prominent types of moral behavior. These include exercising authority over others, resolving conflicts, controlling one's own emotions, and fortifying one's own passions against fear.

                It is common to refer to Thomas Aquinas as a natural law theorist. Although a key component of his moral philosophy, natural law is also a contentious and misunderstood concept. The ideas outlined above are similar to how the natural law operates. Good is to be done and evil is to be avoided, according to Aquinas, who also holds that this fundamental principle or precept is the basis and prerequisite for all practical reasoning. It is not possible for us to disregard or violate this concept. Instead, it is a representation of the way that rational thought and action flow in beings like us. Every time we consider what to do, we do so because we have an innate desire to pursue (or refrain from) those things that advance (or hinder) our perfection as human beings.
